June 2015
* HF to kcal unit conversion error (621 instead of 627) corrected
* ameobna_v2_new_head.prm updated to remove the opbendunit, the opbend force constants now 71.94x bigger than before (changed in valence.py). This is consistent with amoebapro2013.prm and amoeba09.prm.
July 3, 2015
Mono Cl vdw parameters updated according to JPCB 2014, 118 (24), pp 6456â€“6465.
Can NOT detect multiple Cl and assign the corresponding parameters yet

Using Python3 for easier installation of dependencies via anaconda/miniconda
--freq to do a frequency QM computation during QM optimization
--torsppcm to specify PCM of water during QM SP computations for torsion, if molecule is charged, this is on by default
--sppcm to specify PCM of water during QM SP computation, if molecule is charged, this is on by default
--toroptpcm to specify PCM of water during QM Opt computations for torsion, if molecule is charged, this is on by default
--optpcm to specify PCM of water during QM Opt computation, if molecule is charged, this is on by default
--use_psi4 to specify to use Psi4 for QM SP and Opt rather than Gaussian 09
--use_psi4SPonly to specify to use Psi4 for QM SP only and use Opt from Gaussian 09, in case they have better optimization algorithm performance
--dontdotor quit program before spinning torsions
--dontdotorfit quit program before torsion fitting
--rotalltors always rotate any torsion that babel considers rotatable
--onlyrotbnd=idx1,idx2 only rotate specified atom indices
--torsionrestraint change tinker torsion restraint constant, default force constant is .1
--foldnum=integer change number of cosine terms in torsion fitting function, default is 3
--tordatapointsnum=integer change number of data points needed to sample energy/dihedral angle profile for all torsions, default is 12. If too many torsions are being fit to same bond for 12 data points, more datapoints are automatically added
--dont-tor-qm-opt specifies to not use QM for optimization during torsion spinning, this is by default False so QM Opt is on by default
--fitrotbnds specifies to make a file with extension .fitrotbnds where there is a column list of rotatable bond indexes that are comma seperated, each bond pair will undergo torsion spinning and fitting
